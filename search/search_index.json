Employees pay between 15% and 16% of their salaries into pension funds: 4% is deducted from the salary, and 11.5%<sup>1</sup>  rest is paid by employer (on top of salary). The biggest part of the Icelandic labor market is bound to certain pension funds by collective agreements, but for ~40% of workers, they have a choice to pick their pension fund. Information on the pension fund employees are members of should, by law, be stated in the employment contract.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Popular pension funds are L\u00edfeyrissj\u00f3\u00f0ur Verslunarmanna (for retail workers) or Gildi l\u00edfeyrissj\u00f3\u00f0ur (for tourism/service sectors).

These are similar to 401k's in the US. Up to 4% is deducted from an employees salary before tax and deposited in a pension account, and the employer is required to match up to 2% (hence a 2% salary increase). Employer-matched contributions to s\u00e9reignarsparna\u00f0ur are considered a tax-free benefit, making it an efficient way to grow your retirement savings with minimal tax impact. There's a host of management companies to choose from, including all the pension funds and banks. In recent years, the government has leveraged the extra pension in creative ways, for example by allowing first time home buyers to directly deposit their extra pension into their mortgage. The additional pension can be withdrawn from the age of 60 years. Monitor your pension statements to track contributions and returns.</p> <p>Special Rule for Government Jobs:</p> <p>If you work for the government (national or municipal), you cannot choose your mandatory pension fund; it is determined by the government.
