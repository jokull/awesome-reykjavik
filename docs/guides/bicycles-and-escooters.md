# Bicycles and E-scooters

Bicycle lanes are plentiful in Reykjavik. Therefore there are quite a few
people who travel around exclusively by bicycle or e-scooter. They are good for
getting around the city, and during rush hour it may even be quicker than
driving. However, in Reykjavik, it's possible to lose your driver's license if
you ride a bicycle drunk. So, be careful.

There are three rental e-scooter companies in Reykjavik: Zolo, Hopp, and Bolt.
E-scooters don't work very well in winds that are over 12 m/s or when paths are icy.

The downtown area also has bike rentals for tourists on week days.

But if you want to buy your own bicycle or e-scooter, you can compare and
contrast all of the new vehicles at [Orflaedi.is](https://www.orflaedi.is/). It
lists the different shops, brands, and prices. If you do buy a new bicycle,
then remember to bring your bike back to the shop to get the chain tightened
and adjusted within in the first six months.

Bicycles with schrader valves can be inflated at the numerous bicycle repair
stations.  They can also be inflated at gas station air pumps. In the past,
Bike Cave was a restaurant/bicycle repair shop near the Reykjavik airport where
you could use their full bicycle toolset to repair your bike.

In the winter, the paths are cleared quite regularly and salted. This allows
for even road bikes to operate in the winter. However, on snowy days it may
take two to three days for the city to get to every path. Also, many cyclists
get winter bike tires, as in tires with studs.
