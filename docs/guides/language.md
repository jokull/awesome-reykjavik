# Language

The official language of Iceland is Icelandic. English is very widely spoken,
and it's unlikely that you'll encounter anyone in your day-to-day life who isn't
able to communicate effectively in English. Polish, Ukrainian, and Lithuanian
also are spoken here due to the large immigrant populations in Iceland, which
can be seen in Statistics Iceland.

However, it will certainly smooth your daily interactions to understand key
phrases used in shops and restaurants. It will also be helpful to be able to
say your phone number and kennitala in Icelandic.

## Studying Icelandic

There are a number of institutions offering Icelandic courses aimed at
foreigners. Most of them are heavily subsidised by your union membership.

- [Háskóli Íslands](https://english.hi.is/school_of_humanities_faculty_of_icelandic_and_comparative_cultural_studies/icelandic_as_a_second) BA and practical diploma programs
- [The Tin Can Factory](http://thetincanfactory.eu/index.html)
- [Mímir](https://www.mimir.is/)
- [Icelandic made easier](https://www.icelandicmadeeasier.com/)

An alternative for people who can't attend school for whatever reason is the
wealth of free Icelandic learning resources hosted by tungumalatorg and
[mms.is](mms.is) run by Miðstöð menntunar og skólaþjónustu.  For
Tungumálatorg.is, the most famous example is (Íslenska fyrir
alla](https://tungumalatorg.is/ifa/)

## Icelandic tests

In order to become Icelandic citizens, a large majority of immigrants need to
pass an Icelandic language test. Here is an example from the government of the
test given out: https://mms.is/sites/mms.is/files/synisprof_ipr_24.pdf
The Icelandic citizenship test as well as the Icelandic residency test are both
administered by Mimir on behalf of the government.
