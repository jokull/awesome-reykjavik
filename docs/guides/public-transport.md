Strætó operates buses across the capital area. Bus schedules and route information is accessible via Google Maps, Transit, Moovit and in the [Strætó app](https://www.straeto.is/en/um-straeto/straeto-appid).

To ride the bus, buy a ticket using the Strætó app. You can buy tickets in advance using a credit or debit card (excluding American Express). Tap on the ticket to activate it when boarding the bus. Show the driver your phone as you board.

The app also has a route planner and a live map to see when the bus is coming.

Monthly and annual passes are available but don't provide significant savings unless you're using the bus every day.

!!! warning
    Buses accept cash payments but don't provide change. Buy a ticket using the app instead.
