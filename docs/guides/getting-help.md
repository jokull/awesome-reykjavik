# Getting help

The emergency number in Iceland is 112. This is to be used only in life
threatening and urgent situations. Otherwise the police station is open from
8:15 - 17:00.

Other places to get help are [Samtokin
'78](https://samtokin78.is/english/) if you're queer, and [The Women's Shelter
(Kvenna Athvarf)](https://kvennaathvarf.is/?lang=en) if you're a woman.
