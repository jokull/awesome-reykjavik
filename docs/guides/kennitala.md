# Kennitala

*a.k.a. ID number / Social security number*

Iceland uses a national ID system called kennitala. It's a single ID number that's used for tax, insurance, car registration, bank transfers, receipts and much more. It's essential to apply for a kennitala as soon as you arrive as it's used for just about everything that involves ID.

Your kennitala is a 10 digit number where the first six numbers are your date of birth in the format DDMMYYY. Kennitalas are public and don't contain any secret information (apart from your data of birth).

Companies also have kennitalas.

!!! tip
    If you are staying less than three months and are a national of the EU/EEA
    you can quickly obtain a 3-month temporary kennitala by [submitting an
    A-263 form](https://www.rsk.is/media/rsk03/rsk_0330.en.pdf) to Skatturinn
    (the tax authority). They will then get you a temporary kennitala in a few
    days.

## EU/EEA

It’s relatively simple for residents of the EU/EEA to acquire a kennitala.

!!! warning
    As of 2020, individuals can no longer apply for a kennitala directly with Þjóðskrá (the national register).
    If you have a job in Iceland, ask your employer to apply for one through Skatturinn (local tax
    authorities).

If you intend to stay more than three months you need to prove your EU/EEA residency after filing digitally an A-271 form. ).

!!! warning
    You will need the EXACT address of your temporary residence including the
    legally registered apartment number (usually in a four-digital format, 0301
    for "third floor apartment number one"). The address is queried dynamically
    and will not be found if you don’t include correct Icelandic alphabet
    letters such as ð, þ or ö. You may want to get this information emailed to
    you and copy-paste from there.

## Outside EU/EEU

The process here is similar (in theory), but you will likely need an employer
to vouch for you and get you on the expert knowledge program first. See the
[Working in Iceland guide](./working-in-iceland.md).
