# Driver’s license

If you have a driving licence from an EEA country you can drive in Iceland
using your foriegn licence for the first 6 months. It's a good idea to trade in
your driver's licence for an Icelandic one as soon as possible. This will
likely be your main physical Icelandic ID.

## Trading a foreign license

You can trade in your driving licence at Sýslumaðurinn (The office of the
district magistrate). Go to your local branch to fill in the required form.
Alternatively, you can email [smh@syslumenn.is](mailto:smh@syslumenn.is) or
call +354 458 2000.

An application usually includes:

- A 35x45 mm photograph of the applicant.
- The foreign driver’s license.
- A statement of good health or a health certificate.

!!!tip
    If you require glasses to drive, you may need to get a note from a
    doctor to confirm your vision is adequate for driving.
