# Cars

Icelanders love cars. We export energy and fish and import cars. We have
extremely high car ownership per household. 

Cars can be looked up on [the public vehicle registry](https://island.is/en/information-from-vehicle-registrar). Cars in the capital area tend to have more rust than up north because Reykjavik salts their roads but Akureyri does not. Car registration and transfers are handled online but you can also submit a paper form to the [Icelandic Transport Authority (Samgöngustofa)](https://island.is/en/o/transport-authority) offices. A car must be free of any fees before ownership can be transfered. Choosing car insurance is bundled into the car buying process. 

## Electric

We are number two in the world in the adoption of electric cars. The charging
infrastructure is subsidized and building up quickly.

[Veldu Rafbíl](https://veldurafbil.is) is an excellent place to start with
links to local resellers. It also indexes the electrics listed on Bílasölur.is.

## Used cars

The biggest used car aggregator is [Bílasölur.is](https://bilasolur.is). People
also buy and sell passenger vehicles on [Facebook (search results for "bílar
til sölu")](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=b%C3%ADlar%20til%20sölu&epa=SEARCH_BOX).

## Tires
Used tires are sold by Sorpa and [Vaka](https://vaka.is/en/?lang=en). Vaka also changes tires. Studded tires are allowed in the winter time and there are usually notices in the papers about when the government will start fining cars with studs. However, in the capital area, all-weather tires are usually sufficient. The main roads tend to be cleared quickly and regularly when it snows.
