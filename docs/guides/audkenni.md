# Auðkenni (Electronic Certificates)

Once you have a [mobile plan](./mobile-phones.md) and [kennitala](./kennitala.md) you can get the electronic certificate.

Auðkenni uses a secret token on your phone SIM card and a pin code system to let you identify yourself in services such as:

1. Digital banking
1. Filing taxes
1. Use various public services
1. View your pension rights
1. Manage your insurance
1. Book time with a doctor

The easiest way to get Auðkenni is to activate it in a bank branch when you [open a bank account](./bank-account.md).
