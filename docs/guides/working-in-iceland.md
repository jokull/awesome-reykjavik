# Working in Iceland

It’s super easy for EU/EEA residents to relocate and work in Iceland. For
knowledge experts it’s quite possible, and for anyone else it’s a long and
difficult process.

## EU/EEA Trade agreements

Anyone with citizenship within the
[EU/EEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area) area is allowed
to relocate freely and work in Iceland without any special license or work
permit. For anyone outside this area it becomes much more complicated.

## Worker’s rights

On paper and when enforced, worker’s rights in Iceland are strong. However,
many Icelandic companies do not respect worker’s rights. All workers earn 24
working days of summer holiday every year. They have additional sick leave
rights and cannot be asked to work for an excessive amount of hours. They are
entitled to appropriate clothing and security at their workplace.

Look to [Efling](https://efling.is/?lang=en) immediately if you are a non-desk
worker and suspect your rights are not being observed.

## Expert knowledge workers

When companies require expert knowledge workers that are hard to find in Iceland and other EEA countries, they may contract an expert and acquire a temporary work permit on their behalf.

Many companies are unaware of the tax benefits available to expert foreigners moving to Iceland. The tax benefits are for the worker, so it's up to the employee to submit the application.

## Some (midly) interesting bits about employment in Iceland

### Minimum wage and legal stuff
The main legal contracts surrounding employment are Collective Bargaining Agreements (is. Kjarasamningar) and then the individual agreements between employee and employer. There are no laws that mandate minimum wages or minimum benefits. They are governed through the collective agreements of labor unions and employer groups.

### Unions
In many cases, employees are legally required to be part of a union, or at the minimum, pay into a union. Knowledge workers and experts usually have more control over this and can choose between unions. Unions are either for government and private market workers, and then within those two main categories, they're divided into groups and unions based on type of work and education.

### Pension funds & voluntary extra pension
The pension system in Iceland is semi-privatised. This means that the pension funds are indepentent funds, but paying into them is mandatory. Employees pay between 15% and 16% of their salaries into pension funds: 4% is deducted from the salary, and the rest is paid by employer (on top of salary). The biggest part of the Icelandic labor market is bound to certain pension funds by collective agreements, but for ~40% of workers, they have a choice to pick their pension fund.  

Employees have the option of contributing to additional, voluntary,  pension. These are similar to IRA's in the US. Up to 4% is deducted from an employees salary *before tax* and deposited in a pension account, and the employer is *required* to match up to 2% (hence a 2% salary increase). There's a host of management companies to choose from. In recent years, the government has leveraged the extra pension in creative ways, for example by allowing first time home buyers to directly deposit their extra pension into their mortgage.

!!! note
	While employees are only allowed to deposit up to 4% of their salary in extra pension, employers can pay more towards the extra pension. If you're negotiating salary (and foresee that you'd like this extra pension) you can always ask for a higher percentage paid by the employer into extra pension.
