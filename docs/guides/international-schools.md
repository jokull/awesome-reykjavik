# International Schools

There are two options for international grade school education in the capital area. For pre-bachelor entry into higher education MH provides a two year IB corriculum. 

Iceland has a ten year compulsary grade school level and then three at the pre-bachelor level ("menntaskóli"), which means people are at their 19th year when entering higher education. The pre-bachelor level was shortened form four years in 2015, with schools gradually complying.

## IB at Menntaskólinn við Hamrahlíð

[Menntaskólinn við Hamrahlíð](https://www.mh.is/is/ib-studies) (colloquially known as just "MH") offers, among its modular programmes, a standardized International Baccalaureate two-year program. It is attended by a mix of Icelandic students who are returning from English based foreign education abroad and foreign students. 

MH also provides a one-year pre-IB which is also taught in English which helps bridge the local grade school 10th grade with the two year program.

Icelandic universities accept IB graduates just as recipients of the local "stúdentspróf".
