# International Schools

There are two options for international grade school education in the capital area. For pre-bachelor entry into higher education MH provides a two year IB corriculum.

Iceland covers primary and lower secondary education with its Grunnskóli. Then there are three years of upper secondary education called menntaskóli. This means people are at their 19th year when entering higher education. The upper secondary level was shortened from four years in 2015, with schools complying gradually.

## IB at Menntaskólinn við Hamrahlíð

[Menntaskólinn við Hamrahlíð](https://www.mh.is/is/ib-studies) (colloquially known as just "MH") offers, among its modular programmes, a standardized International Baccalaureate two-year program. It is attended by a mix of Icelandic students who are returning from English based foreign education abroad and foreign students.

MH also provides a one-year pre-IB which is also taught in English which helps bridge the local grade school 10th grade with the two year program.

Icelandic universities accept IB graduates just as recipients of the local "stúdentspróf".
