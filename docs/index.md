## The Trinity: Kennitala, Mobile Plan and Bank Account

You’re basically a tourist until you get a kennitala. It’s a ten digit personal
identity that is used *everwhere* in Iceland. If you have employment in Iceland
and are willing to wait up to 5 days with your foreign SIM card until you
acquire kennitala, this is the order of things:

1. :material-fingerprint: **Get a kennitala** →
   [Kennitala](guides/kennitala.md). This takes five days to process if all
   documents are submitted correctly. Start this process online before you
   depart for Iceland.
2. :material-phone: **Get a mobile plan** → [Mobile
   plans](guides/mobile-phones.md). You'll need to
   visit a telco branch and bring your passport. Use your non-Icelandic credit
   card for billing as you haven't opened a bank account yet.
3. :material-bank: **Get a bank account** → [Bank
   account](guides/bank-account.md). Visit a branch to open a bank account and set up your [electronic certificate](guides/audkenni.md).

You can activate the electronic certificate on your visit to the telco branch
and skip the bank visit if you like, opting instead to sign up via one of the
bank apps.

There are of course other ways to go about it, but this is probably the
quickest way to onboard.
