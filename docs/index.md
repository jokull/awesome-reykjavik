## The Trinity: Kennitala, Mobile Plan and Bank Account

!!! warning
    This is a draft section, we are still verifying this works as described.
    We’re not 100% sure that Auðkenni can be activated with kennitala and
    passport alone.

If you are being employed in Iceland, assuming you have a permanent residence,
this is the order of things:

1. :material-fingerprint: **Get a kennitala** →
   [Kennitala](guides/kennitala.md). This takes five days to process if all
   documents are submitted correctly.
2. :material-phone: **Get a mobile plan** → [Mobile
   plans](guides/mobile-phones.md). Sign up for a monthly plan and get a
   verified [electronic certificate](guides/audkenni.md). You will need to
   visit a telco branch and bring your passport. Use your non-Icelandic credit
   card for billing as you are not yet banked.
3. :material-bank: **Get bank account** → [Bank
   account](guides/bank-account.md). Once you have Auðkenni, you can get banked
   directly online without visiting a branch. 

There are of course other ways to go about it, but this is probably the
quickest way to onboard.
